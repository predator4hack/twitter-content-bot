# Video Extraction Error

First, I want you to analyse the whole project and understand its working. The whole flow of this project is:

    - User enters a Youtube video
    - A video processing pipeline downloads the video, thumbnail is also extracted
    - Transcripts are extracted using a model
    - An LLM reads the transcripts and outputs the timings when the video should be clipped so that it can be used for a twitter post
    - An LLM creates a tweet thread

When passing the Youtube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rABwKRsec4
The console is throwing up the error:

```
WARNING: [youtube] 8rABwKRsec4: Failed to parse JSON (caused by JSONDecodeError("Expecting value in '': line 1 column 1 (char 0)")); please report this issue on  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q= , filling out the appropriate issue template. Confirm you are on the latest version using  yt-dlp -U
ERROR: [youtube] 8rABwKRsec4: Failed to extract any player response; please report this issue on  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues?q= , filling out the appropriate issue template. Confirm you are on the latest version using  yt-dlp -U
```

I need you to first analyse the error and figure out what is wrong and what is causing it. Once you are done, provide a detailed description on what you think is going wrong and how to fix it before moving to the implementation.

Once user agrees with your rationale, you can proceed with fixing the issue.
